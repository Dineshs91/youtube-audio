# youtube-audio
Listen to audio on youtube.

## Motivation
Most of the times while working I listen to songs on youtube. But the bandwidth gets used for video.
I felt there was lot of bandwidth being wasted. Hence I decided to write this chrome extension.

This extension tries to get the audio and play it. If it is not able to do so, then the usual behaviour of youtube is restored.
It honours the autoplay option as well (Which is one of my feature functionality in youtube). 

## Credits
This project would not have been possible without the awesome [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) project.
The code for extracting the audio is a direct port from this project.
